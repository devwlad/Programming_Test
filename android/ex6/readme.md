This app (a service, in reality) applies the code from ex5 to a Email Thread Cleaner context.
By applying this code, it shares the same complexity of O(n).

There are two folders here:

* EmailThreadCleaner - Have the Service (with no activity), to be called by other apps.

* EmailThreadCleaner_activity2 - Have the same code as above with added classes and an activity, used only for test purposes. - Sadly, it's not finished and can't be used (breaks when loading the LinkedList used to populate the ListView in the MainActivity).

Complexity: O(n)
